# Dog-Cat Classifier
A dog and cat classifier created using convolutional neural networks using the library keras in python.The model uses adam as optimizer and accuracy as metric. The model achieved a test set accuracy of 85%.

## Setup
Building this projects requires Python3 to run the script CODE/kerasModel.py . The model is trained and saved in the file CODE/trained_model.h5 .

## Dependecies
 the following python packages:

* Keras
* PIL
* numpy
* webrowser

## Making prediction
Set the directory name in the variable 'image_predict' and run the code under the comment 'Train the model'
The result will open in a separate browser window.

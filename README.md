# Dog-Cat Classifier
A dog and cat classifier created using convolutional neural networks using the library keras in python.The model has two convolution layer and uses adam as optimizer and accuracy as metric. The model achieved a test set accuracy of 85%.

## Setup
Building this projects requires Python3 to run the script Code/kerasModel.py . The model is trained and saved in the file Code/trained_model.h5 .

## Dependecies
 the following python packages:

* Keras
* PIL
* numpy
* webrowser

## Making prediction
Set the directory name in the variable 'image_predict' and run the code under the comment 'Train the model'
The result will open in a separate browser window.

# Dog - Cat Classifier
A dog and cat classifier with an accuracy of 79%. It is written in python using the keras library.

## Getting started
You must first need to train your model on a dataset of cats and dogs. The images of cats and dogs must be in separate folders
and add those images to the training set and test set. By default the directory structure is 'dataset/trainging_set' and
'dataset/test_set'

## Prerequisites
You must first need to install all the libraries that are required to run the script. These include:

* Keras
* PIL
* numpy
* webrowser

## Making single prediction
Set the directory name in the variable 'image_predict' and run the code under the comment 'Train the model'

And bam.. The result will open in a separate browser window.
